# Graduation from Czech Universities

## Introduction

In this project, I'll be taking the data from this Kaggle Dataset, "Graduation from Czech universities" (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jetakow/graduation-from-czech-universities/data) through the entire Data Science process.

To work with this data, I will use the CRISP-DM Methodology.

## 01. Business Understanding

The first step in the CRISP-DM Methodology is Business Understanding. In this step, our goal is to understand the business problem; what we hope to gather from the data in order to get a solution.

### Questions to answer at the end of the methodology
- What was the biggest cause of not graduating?
- Which programs have the highest graduation rates?

## 02. Data Understanding

In this stage, our goal is to understand the data and its contents.

## 03. Data Preparation

In this stage, our goal is to manipulate and transform the data in order to use it more effectively in later stages. I'll identify and handle any potential missing data, remove duplicates, identify and handle outliers, normalize and standardize the data, handle inconsistent data, perform string encoding, and save this new dataset which will then be used in the following stages.

## 04. Modeling

## 05. Evaluation

## 06. Deployment

## Conclusion
